    "# TITLE: PERFORM DATA WRANGLING AND ETL PROCESSES ON A DATASET, FOLLOWED BY EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA)\n",
    "## 1.1 THEORY\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "##### Data wrangling is the process of converting raw data into a usable form. It may also be called data munging or data remediation. It describes a series of processes designed to explore, transform, and validate raw datasets from their messy and complex forms into high-quality data. We can use our wrangled data to produce valuable insights and guide business decisions. \n",
    "##### Data wrangling steps are systematic stages in transforming raw data into a structured, clean and usable format for analysis. These steps ensure accurate and actionable insights for decision making by addressing raw data's challenges and improving it's usability.\n",
    "#### Data Wrangling Steps\n",
    "##### **1. Discovery** \n",
    "##### Discovery refers to the process of familiarizing with data so we can conceptualize how we might use it. We can liken it to looking in our refrigerator before cooking a meal to see what ingredients we have at our disposal.During discovery, we may identify trends or patterns in the data, along with obvious issues, such as missing or incomplete values that need to be addressed. This is an important step, as it will inform every activity that comes afterward.\n",
    "##### **2. Structuring**\n",
    "##### Raw data is typically unusable in its raw state because it’s either incomplete or misformatted for its intended application. Data structuring is the process of taking raw data and transforming it to be more readily leveraged. The form our data takes will depend on the analytical model we use to interpret it.\n",
    "##### **3. Cleaning**\n",
    "##### Data cleaning is the process of removing inherent errors in data that might distort the analysis or render it less valuable. Cleaning can come in different forms, including deleting empty cells or rows, removing outliers, and standardizing inputs. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure there are no errors (or as few as possible) that could influence the final analysis. Identifying and removing any bad data greatly impacts the rest of the wrangling processes.\n",
    "##### **4. Enriching**\n",
    "##### Enrichment involves adding value to our data by incorporating additional context or merging it with other relevant datasets. This can include combining data from various sources to create new variables or applying domain-specific transformations. For eg: Enrichment could involve segmenting customers into a dataset based on their purchasing behaviour.\n",
    "##### **5. Validation**\n",
    "##### Data validation involves ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your dataset through systematic checks and automated processes. This step is critical for confirming that data is both correct and consistent. Its goal is to catch any issues before the data is used for analysis, preventing errors from impacting the results.\n",
    "##### **6. Data Publishing**\n",
    "##### The final step of data wrangling involves storing the cleared and structured data in a readily accessible format for analysis. This may involve storing data in a database, data warehouse or analytics platform. It also involves documenting data with metadata detailing its content, structure and any transformation it has undergone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation and Normalization Techniques\n",
    "##### **Min-Max Transformation**\n",
    "##### The main purpose of this transformation is it is used when the data has no outliers and if we want to scale it to a specific range[0, 1] for algorithms sensitive to scale, such as K-Nearest Neighbours(K-NN) and Neural Networks.\n",
    "##### **Z-Score Normalization**\n",
    "##### It is used when the data has outliers or when features have different units. Suitable for algorithms like sum and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)\n",
    "##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the initial step in the data analysis process where analysts use statistical and visualization techniques to understand the main characteristics of a dataset. The goal is to summarize its key features, discover patterns, identify anomalies, check assumptions, and test hypotheses. EDA is often used before applying machine learning models or other advanced analytical techniques to ensure the data is clean, well-understood, and ready for further analysis.\n",
    " ### Key Steps in Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    " ##### **1. Understand the Data Structure:**\n",
    " - Data types: Identify and inspect data types for each feature (numerical, categorical, datetime, etc.).\n",
    " - Basic summary statistics: Calculate key metrics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles\n",
    " - Data shape: Check the number of rows (observations) and columns (features) in the dataset.\n",
    "##### **2. Data CLeaning:**\n",
    "- Data cleaning is the process of removing inherent errors in data that might distort the analysis or render it less valuable.\n",
    "-  Cleaning can come in different forms, including deleting empty cells or rows, removing outliers, and standardizing inputs.\n",
    "##### **3. Univariate Analysis (Single Variable):**\n",
    "- Histograms/Bar plots: Visualize the distribution of a single feature. For continuous variables, histograms are useful, while for categorical data, bar plots can be used.\n",
    "- Box plots: Used to detect outliers and understand the spread of data. For numerical features, they show the median, quartiles, and outliers.\n",
    "- Summary statistics: Review the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation to understand central tendencies and variability.\n",
    "##### **4. Bivariate Analysis (Two Variables):**\n",
    "- Scatter plots: Used to explore relationships between two continuous variables, especially for detecting trends or correlations.\n",
    "- Correlation matrix: For numerical features, calculating correlation coefficients (like Pearson or Spearman) can help identify relationships between variables.\n",
    " ##### **5. Multivariate Analysis (Multiple Variables):**\n",
    " - Heatmaps: A heatmap of a correlation matrix can provide a compact view of how multiple features are correlated.\n",
    " - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is used for dimensionality reduction to find underlying patterns in data and visualize high-dimensional data in fewer dimensions.\n",
    " - Cluster analysis: Grouping similar data points together using clustering algorithms like k-means or hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "##### **6. Identify Outliers and Anomalies:**\n",
    "- Use statistical methods (like Z-scores) or visualization techniques (box plots, scatter plots) to detect outliers or anomalous data points that may need to be addressed.\n",
    "##### **7. Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "- Generate new features that might help in analysis or model performance (e.g., combining existing features, transforming data types, etc.).\n",
    "##### **8. Data Visualization:**\n",
    "- Histograms, bar charts, box plots: For univariate analysis.\n",
    "- Scatter plots, line plots: For bivariate relationships.\n",
    "- Heatmaps, pair plots: For multivariate exploration.\n",
    "- Visualizing your data helps identify patterns and potential relationships that might not be obvious from just summary statistics.\n",
    "##### **9.Testing Assumptions:**\n",
    "- Based on the data, test assumptions that might be relevant for future analyses (e.g., checking if data is normally distributed, verifying if certain relationships hold true across different variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)\n",
    "##### **Understanding the Data:**\n",
    "- Before diving into more advanced analysis, EDA allows you to understand the underlying structure of your data, the relationships between variables, and the distribution of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Data Quality Checks:**\n",
    "- EDA helps identify data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, duplicates, or incorrect data types. Addressing these issues is crucial for accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Identifying Patterns and Trends:**\n",
    "- Through visualization and statistical analysis, EDA reveals patterns, correlations, and potential relationships that can inform modeling or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
    "- By exploring the data, you can generate hypotheses that can later be tested with more formal statistical techniques or machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "- EDA helps in identifying the most important features for modeling by evaluating their relevance and importance. You may discard irrelevant or redundant features at this stage."

    "# DISCUSSION\n",
    "##### In this data wrangling lab, we performed a series of essential preprocessing tasks to prepare the dataset for further analysis or machine learning. The first critical step involved handling missing values, where we identified and replaced any missing data, represented by ?, with NaN. Next, we focused on transforming and standardizing the numerical features to bring them to a comparable scale. By applying Z-score standardization and Min-Max scaling, we ensured that the numerical columns were normalized, which is vital for algorithms that are sensitive to feature magnitude or scale. We also engineered a new feature, the Power-to-Weight ratio, which might offer more meaningful insights into the performance of vehicles. Additionally, we categorized the continuous price variable into bins (\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"), which helps simplify price analysis, particularly for models that work with categorical data. Label encoding was applied to categorical variables like fuel_type and body_style, transforming them into numeric values that are machine-learning-friendly.\n",
    "##### Furthermore, we visualized key relationships in the dataset through histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualizations allowed us to uncover patterns and outliers that would otherwise be difficult to detect. The box plot of Price by Body Style further demonstrated the variability in car prices across different body styles, helping us understand the spread and central tendency for each category. These visualizations not only gave us a clearer picture of the dataset’s structure but also guided us in making data-driven decisions for further analysis or model development. Overall, this lab highlighted the significance of thorough data wrangling in preparing datasets for analysis, ensuring that we could extract meaningful insights and use the data effectively for predictive modeling.\n",

    "# CONCLUSION\n",
    "##### This lab demonstrated the importance of data wrangling and feature engineering in transforming raw data into a structured, clean, and insightful format. Through various preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables, we prepared the dataset for further analysis or predictive modeling.\n",
    "##### The visualizations provided crucial insights into the relationships between different features (e.g., engine_size and price, body_style and price), which will help guide the development of a machine learning model by identifying trends, outliers, and correlations. For instance, the scatter plot suggested a positive correlation between engine size and price, while the box plot revealed how different body styles affect the price distribution. Ultimately, this process highlights the significance of data preprocessing in building robust and effective models. By carefully handling data, transforming features, and visualizing relationships, we set the stage for making informed decisions based on the dataset or applying machine learning algorithms that will learn meaningful patterns from the data.\n",
